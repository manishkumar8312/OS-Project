# 🔒 Secure File Management System  
## 📌 Overview 
The **Secure File Management System** is a robust and efficient solution designed to securely store, manage, and share files while ensuring data confidentiality, integrity, and accessibility. It incorporates encryption, authentication, and access control mechanisms to protect sensitive files from unauthorized access.  


## Features 
✅ **Secure File Storage** – Encrypts files before storing them.  
✅ **User Authentication** – Ensures only authorized users can access files.  
✅ **Access Control** – Role-based permissions for file operations.  
✅ **File Versioning** – Keeps track of changes and allows rollback.  
✅ **Secure Sharing** – Encrypted file sharing with expiration options.  
✅ **Audit Logs** – Tracks all user actions for security monitoring.  

## 🛠️ Technologies Used 
- **Backend:** Python (Flask/Django) / Node.js  
- **Frontend:** React / Angular / Vue  
- **Database:** MySQL / PostgreSQL / MongoDB  
- **Security:** AES/RSA Encryption, JWT Authentication  

## 🔐 Security Measures  
🔹 **End-to-End Encryption** – Protects data at rest and in transit.  
🔹 **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)** – Enhances account security.  
🔹 **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** – Limits access to sensitive files.  
🔹 **Secure API Endpoints** – Uses HTTPS, OAuth2, and token-based authentication.  

## 📂 How to Use  
1️⃣ **Sign Up / Log In** – Create an account and authenticate yourself.  
2️⃣ **Upload Files** – Securely upload your files.  
3️⃣ **Manage Files** – Edit, delete, or share files with controlled access.  
4️⃣ **Download Files** – Retrieve files with decryption when needed.
